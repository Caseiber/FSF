This is for my senior engineering design project, which is a parking space sensor.

The program is made to be used with an Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 microcontroller. 

Current functionality allows it to calibrate itself when not under a car, and detect when a car is on top of it. Later modifications will include Bluetooth broadcasting and battery saving functions.
