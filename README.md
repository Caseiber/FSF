# FSF (Free Space Finder)

This is for my senior engineering design project, which is a parking space sensor.

The program is made to be used with an Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 microcontroller. 

Current functionality allows it to calibrate itself when not under a car, and detect when a car is on top of it. Later modifications will include Bluetooth broadcasting and battery saving functions.

### Prerequisites

The Arduino IDE is necessary to run this project, and can be found for free at Ardunio.cc. Additionally, it uses libraries written for a MLX90393 magnetometer and a Sharp IR sensor.
